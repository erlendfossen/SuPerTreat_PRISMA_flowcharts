# SuPerTreat_PRISMA_flowcharts

This repo contains PRISMA flowcharts for a manuscript that is part of SuPerTreat, a project where big data is used for supporting treatment decisions in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. For this manuscript 5 different gene signatures are validated using a large cohort of HNC patients. The data is sensitive and analyses are conducted on a secure server at University of Oslo, but the PRISMA flowcharts are ok to do outside the server.
