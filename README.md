# SuPerTreat_exclusion_flowcharts

This repo contains exclusion flowcharts for a manuscript that is part of SuPerTreat, a project where big data is used for supporting personalized treatment decisions in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. For this manuscript 5 different gene signatures are validated using a large cohort of HNC patients. The data is sensitive and analyses are conducted on a secure server at University of Oslo, but the flowcharts are ok to do outside the server.
